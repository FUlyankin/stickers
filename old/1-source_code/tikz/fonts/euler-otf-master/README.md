**Update: this project is abandoned, the repository is left for ach√¶logical
purposes.**

Our goal is to create an OpenType MATH-enabled font euler.otf, by
combining the existing Euler math fonts with new glyphs from Hermann
Zapf and adding MATH table information.

The MATH table work is almost done, and initial glyph review by Zapf
have been conducted and implemented, see
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb29-2/tb92hagen-euler.pdf and
http://river-valley.tv/reshaping-euler-a-collaboration-with-hermann-zapf/
for more details about the review process. We are planning for another
review before the first official beta.
